# Project Constraints

*Last edited: 10/5/23*

## Scope

The Scope for our project has been one of the primary challenges so far. Finding the right balance between tailoring features specifically for school organizations and versatile enough to accommodate a wider audience outside this scope is something we have been struggling with. The scope also entails the need to define the appâ€™s core functionalities to meet the unique needs of school organizations or whatever scope we plan on defining in the future. The scope also makes it harder to meet the unique needs of school organizations while ensuring scalability and flexibility for potential expansion to other user groups. Striking this balance will be critical in optimizing user experience and market potential.

## Time

Each of the members on our team are full-time students so the difficulty with time comes with trying to handle the many other responsibilities that we have outside of this project while also contributing to this senior design project and completing the tasks that are required. Finding times to meet weekly is troublesome. We may also struggle to include on the features that we decide to implement within the two-semester time frame. We must prioritize the most important ones we decide on based on the data from our surveys.

## Security

For security, we are planning on utilizing an authentication process to have users sign in and provide user/pass information to prevent sensitive student organization from being publicized. As developers, we are not so familiar with creating an authentication process for users from scratch, however, we do know that we need to keep these user/pass credentials in a safe database. Depending on scope and how many users use the app, the scale of the database and its security may have to be tweaked.

## Social

An important constraint of the project is Social. The project's primary objective is to serve the public and benefit college community, with a focus on aiding Student Organizations. This Event Management app is designed to address the specific challenges faced by these groups in terms of planning events. Student Organizations often comprise volunteers with limited resources and event planning experience. This application aims to empower them by streamlining the event planning process, making it more accessible and efficient. It provides tools and guidance to help students organize and execute successful events, ultimately enhancing their ability to contribute positively to their communities.
